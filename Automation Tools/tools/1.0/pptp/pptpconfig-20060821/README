Introduction

This is a program for configuration and management of PPTP Client
tunnels on Linux.

Features

    * configuration, starting, stopping, catching debug output from
      pppd, ping test of active tunnel,

    * performs routing on tunnel once it starts, and restores on stop,

    * performs changes to DNS configuration in /etc/resolv, and restores,

Dependencies

    * php 4.3.7 or higher, configured --enable-pcntl

    * php-gtk 1.0.0 or higher,

    * pppd 2.4.2 (for GPL-compatible MPPE options),

    * pptp 1.2.0 (for close stderr on fork())

Resources

    * pptpconfig-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz sources,

Building from Source

    * configure php with configure --enable-pcntl, build and install,
      (note that this makes PHP less secure if you have it also in use
      with Apache for service web content)

    * build and install php-gtk,

    * test php-gtk's test/gtk.php will run,

    * download pptpconfig-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz, untar somewhere,

    * backup /etc/ppp and anything you normally would, in case I have
      made a mistake that wipes our your work or configuration,

    * run "pptpconfig.php" as root (or in a chroot jail with
      a copy of /etc/ that it can write to), and a window should
      appear,

    * enter tunnel details, click on add, check the /etc/ppp file
      changes were made,

    * select the tunnel and click on start, check the output for
      problems.

Tested by me so far on Debian 3.0.
