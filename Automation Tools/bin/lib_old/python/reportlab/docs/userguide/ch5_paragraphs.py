The $reportlab.platypus.Paragraph$ class is one of the most useful of the Platypus $Flowables$;
it can format fairly arbitrary text and provides for inline font style and colour changes using
an XML style markup. The overall shape of the formatted text can be justified, right or left ragged
or centered. The XML markup can even be used to insert greek characters or to do subscripts.

paragraph; excess white space is removed from the text at the ends and internally after
