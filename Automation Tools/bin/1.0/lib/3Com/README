The default IP address of a new WXR100 is 192.168.10.100
To set the IP address of the WXR100 use a set cmd
or the quickstart program (see below):

WXR100# set system ip-address 10.10.250.12
WXR100# set ip route default 10.10.251.1 1
WXR100# set interface 1 ip 10.10.250.12 255.255.255.0


  -or-

WXR100# quickstart
        IP addr: 192.168.1.101 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.1

### Configuring a Distributed MAP or "dap" in the CLI:
###

set dap <dap#> serial-id <id> model ap2750 [ radiotype { 11a | 11b | 11g } ]

for WXR100, dap is 1 to 8
for WX1200, dap is 1 to 30
for WX2200, dap is 1 to 300
for WX4400, dap is 1 to 300

note, we probably should not validate dap# parameters (so we allow
people to test feeding bogus dap#'s to the WLC to see what it does)

serial-id is the serial ID listed on the MAP case.  To see the serial ID
using the CLI, use

display version details

Valid AP model numbers:

	ap2750
	ap3750
	ap7250

Valid radio types:	11a	11b	11g

### Configuring a Distributed MAP or "dap" in the CLI:
###

set dap <dap#> serial-id <id> model ap2750 [ radiotype { 11a | 11b | 11g } ]

for WXR100, dap is 1 to 8
for WX1200, dap is 1 to 30
for WX2200, dap is 1 to 300
for WX4400, dap is 1 to 300

note, we probably should not validate dap# parameters (so we allow
people to test feeding bogus dap#'s to the WLC to see what it does)

serial-id is the serial ID listed on the MAP case.  To see the serial ID
using the CLI, use

display version details


To configure Distributed MAP connection 1 for MAP model AP2750 with serial-ID M9DE48B123400 use this:

set dap 1 serial-id M9DE48B123400 model ap2750
success: change accepted

"set dap" has the same syntax as the "set port type ap" command, except
that "set dap" does not allow you to specify the poe parameter


-----
To configure a user in the local password database on the WX switch:

	set user <username> password <password>

to give that user the ability to enter enable mode:

	set user <username> attr service-type 6

If the service-type is not set to 6 (Administrative)
then the user will not be able to enter enable-mode commands.

-----
To set the enable password

	set enablepass

the system then prompts you for old and new passwords
-----

to get rid of ports, you clear them
If the port is a MAP access port, clearing the port disables PoE and 802.1X auth
If the port is a wired auth port, clearing the port disables 802.1X auth
If the port is a network port, the port must first be removed from all VLAN's,
which removes the port from all spanning trees, load sharing port groups, etc.

clear port type port-list
ie.,
	clear port type 5

clearing a Distributed MAP:

	clear dap dap-num

setting a port name:

	set port <port> name <name>

	ex: set port 2 name adminpool

removing a port name

	clear port <port-list> <name>

configuring port parameters:

	10/100 ports - autonegotiation and port speed

		set port speed <port-list> {10 | 100 | auto}

		ex: set port speed 1,3-5 10

turning ports on/off

	set port {enable | disable} <port-list>
