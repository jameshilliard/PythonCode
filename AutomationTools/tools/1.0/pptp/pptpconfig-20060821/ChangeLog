	* pptpconfig.php: add start, stop and status options.

		pptpconfig [-q] [tunnel {start|stop|status}]

	If no command line arguments are given, the normal GUI behavior is
	executed.  '-q' optionally specified quiet behavior, in which case
	no output is written and the exit code indicates success or
	failure.  The name of a previously configured tunnel is specified,
	followed by the command to execute.  'start' and 'stop' are the
	same as clicking the start or stop buttons in the GUI, and
	'status' returns a string and error code to indicate if the tunnel
	is currently active or not.

	ppp_mppe, so as to be portable to other MPPE implementations.

Sat Jun 19 18:43:18 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptpconfig.php: bug fix, do not assume a dial-up route for
	all-to-tunnel mode.  Support all-to-tunnel for all types of route.

	* pptpconfig.php: bug fix, ping was locking application.  Add
	generalised asynchronous command execution function.  Reported by
	Bruno Negrao.

	* pptpconfig.php: adapt to corrected PHP stream implementation,
	removing the need for different pipe methods, special markers, and
	padding to flush the standard I/O buffers used by fgets().
	stream_set_blocking() now works for pipes.

	* pptpconfig.php, pptpconfig.xml: add refuse-eap option to GUI.

	* pptpconfig.php, pptpconfig.xml: remove all-to-tunnel window
	prompt for external public network interface, and derive this from
	"ip route get".

	* pptpconfig.php: wrap undo load not there dialog.

	* pptpconfig.php: show as green the "Using interface" and
	"Connect: ppp" lines as sent by pppd.

	hold gtk::input_add identifiers, the alternative method was too
	complex.

	* pptpconfig.php: explain pppd "exit 0" as being "started", and
	all other exit codes as "failed".

	* pptpconfig.xml: rename window from "pptpconfig-setup" to
	"pptpconfig".  Rename list heading to "PPTP Client Tunnel List".
	Review and change a few of the tooltips.  Explain routing options
	better.
	
	* pptpconfig.php: remove public network interface button, as it
	can be derived from "ip route get".  Generalise all to tunnel for
	point to point and broadcast interfaces.  Use "ip route replace"
	instead of "route del" followed by "route add", so that no packets
	are lost.

Fri Jun 18 09:53:11 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* Makefile, pptpconfig.app, pptpconfig.pam, pptpconfig.spec: merge
	work by Paul Howarth, move pptpconfig.pam & pptpconfig.app
	creation from spec file to patch, move renaming and editing of
	files for pptp-php-gtk -> pptpconfig name change from install to
	prep phase, try to migrate existing tunnel definitions from the
	old pptp-php-gtk package, patch Makefile to make it properly
	usable in the RPM build, patch Makefile to add install-pam target,
	use Makefile for install process.

	tunnel is connected, so as to help prevent some routing loops.
	Thanks to Chris Wilson for the research into using "ip route get".

	* pptp-php-gtk.php: include additional diagnosis information in
	debug mode, add colour highlighting of messages generated by pptp
	itself, add "save as" option to save tunnel log to a file.

Mon May 31 09:24:39 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptp-php-gtk.php: compatibility fix, new versions of PPP
	packaged by Fedora project place resolv.conf in /var/run/ppp.

	* pptp-php-gtk.php: resolv.conf options field, inspired by work
	done by Christopher R. Wren, but includes any options not only
	search order.

Fri Feb 20 12:09:09 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

Fri Oct 24 20:42:15 2003  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptp-php-gtk.php (stats_show): remove byte and packet counter
	colour highlighting when changed, as the change of styles induced
	a memory leak and it was not clear how to avoid this.

Thu Jul 31 09:44:09 2003  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptp-php-gtk.php: restore default route to public interface
	after tunnel terminates.  From: John Donners.

Wed Jun  4 17:41:37 2003  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	lack of support in GTK+ 1.2.  Need to wait for 2.0.
