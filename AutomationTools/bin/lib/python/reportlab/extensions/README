This directory is intended to act as a placeholder for extending ReportLab
with extra extensions. It has been packagised with an empty __init__.py.

So a typical extender should add his package extension as

    reportlab/extensions/great_extension/__init__.py
                                        /dingo.py
                                        /etc etc

and single modules as

    reportlab/extensions/my_module.py

Then client code can do

    from reportlab.extensions.great_extension import dingo

if you extend with just a single module it might be simpler to add that
into extensions so that you could do

    from reportlab.extensions import my_module.


ReportLab can take no responsibility for name clashes and problems caused by
modules and packages in reportlab/extensions.
