Installation against previous testbed:
1) perl -MCPAN -e"force install Proc::ProcessTable"
2) perl -MCPAN -e"force install DBI"
3) yum install mysql
4) yum install mysql-devel*
5) yum install perl-DBD-MySQL.i386
6) perl -MCPAN -e"force install DBD::mysql"
7) add one line in file .bashrc
export G_DATABASE_SERVER= database_ipaddress
source ~/.bashrc

Start a new round test:
1) cd $SQAROOT/bin/1.0/common/ATLAS/tools

2) insert data into ATLAS
   2.1 perl inset_tsuite.pl -p bhr2e -v 20.13.2 -d 192.168.10.238
   2.2 perl inset_firmware.pl -p bhr2e -v 20.13.2 -d 192.168.10.238
   2.3 perl inset_tcase.pl -p bhr2e -v 20.13.2 -d 192.168.10.238 -t all
Note: # options -p -v and -d should be consistent
      # -t all means all testcase information, you could also insert a single
one. The supported testsutie name refer to perl inset_tcase.pl -h
      # no need to do step 1 and 2 if you have already done it before
   2.4 In database ATLAS, insert product information
       e.g. bhr2e and bhr2f
       insert into product values('bhr2e', 'MI424WRE', 'MI424WRE', 'Version', 'Actiontec', '');
       insert into product values('bhr2f', 'MI424WRF', 'MI424WRF', 'Version', 'Actiontec', '');
   2.5 In database ATLAS, insert testbed information
       e.g. insert into testbed values ('tb21', 'bhr2e', 'testbed_21', '4', '192.168.100.28', 'FC10', '');

3) open a new terminal, give a tile - daemon_monitor

4) in this terminal, cd $SQAROOT/bin/1.0/common/Gfdaemon

5) in this terminal, perl tbdaemon.pl
Note: You don't have to do step 3, 4 and 5 if you have already done. Anyway,
you don't need to worry about it if you do it again since computer wouldn't be
insane for two times excuting. 

6) download the firmware which is going to test from firmware server sengftp.actiontec.com
then, load it to G_FTP_SERVER under its public directory /var/ftp/
Notice, BHR2 has two different dir, they are
bhr2e
bhr2f
The firmware name is defined as <VersionNum><its original name>, e.g.
20.13.2MI424WR-GEN2.rmt

7) Open a brower, go to url http://192.168.10.238/atlas

8) submit a new job, you could find it running status in 'Status' page. The
new job wouldn't be started till less than 10 minutes.
